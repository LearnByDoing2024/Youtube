      "The main types of statistical measures used to summarize and describe data are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Mean**: The mean, also known as the arithmetic mean, is a measure of central tendency that represents the average value of a dataset. It is calculated by summing up all the values in the dataset and then dividing by the number of observations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example: If we have a dataset {2, 4, 6, 8}, the mean would be (2+4+6+8)/4 = 10/4 = 2.5\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Median**: The median is another measure of central tendency that represents the middle value of a dataset when it is arranged in order. If there are an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example: If we have a dataset {1, 3, 5, 7}, the median would be (3+5)/2 = 4\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Mode**: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. A dataset can have multiple modes if there are multiple values that appear with the same frequency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example: If we have a dataset {1, 2, 2, 3}, the mode would be 2 because it appears twice, which is more than any other value.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Range**: The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values in a dataset.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example: If we have a dataset {10, 20, 30}, the range would be 30-10 = 20\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Variance**: The variance is a measure of how spread out the values are from the mean. It is calculated by taking the average of the squared differences between each value and the mean.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example: If we have a dataset {2, 4, 6, 8} with a mean of 5, the variance would be ((2-5)^2 + (4-5)^2 + (6-5)^2 + (8-5)^2) / 4 = (9+1+1+9)/4 = 20/4 = 5\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Standard Deviation**: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance, which represents how spread out the values are from the mean.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example: If we have a dataset {2, 4, 6, 8} with a mean of 5 and a variance of 5, the standard deviation would be √5 = 2.24\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: The IQR is the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1), which represents the range of values that lie within the middle 50% of the dataset.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example: If we have a dataset {1, 2, 2, 3}, Q1 would be 2, and Q3 would be 3. The IQR would be 3-2 = 1\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Percentiles**: Percentiles are values that divide the dataset into hundredths (for 100th percentile) or thousandths (for 1000th percentile). They represent the value below which a certain percentage of observations fall.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example: If we have a dataset {10, 20, 30}, the 25th percentile would be the value below which 25% of the data falls. In this case, it would be 15 (since 25% of the values are below 15).\n",
