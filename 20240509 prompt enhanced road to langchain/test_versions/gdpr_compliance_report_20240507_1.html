            <h2>Response:</h2>
            <p>Let's break it down in a simple way!<br><br>**Mitigating GDPR Risk**<br><br>To mitigate GDPR risk, I recommend:<br><br>• **Conducting regular data audits**: Identify and map your company's personal data processing activities to ensure compliance.<br>• **Implementing robust security measures**: Use encryption, secure storage, and access controls to protect sensitive data.<br>• **Training employees**: Educate staff on GDPR requirements, data handling procedures, and the importance of data protection.<br>• **Establishing incident response plans**: Develop a plan for responding to data breaches or other incidents.<br><br>**Penalties for Non-Compliance**<br><br>If your company fails to comply with GDPR regulations, you may face:<br><br>• **Fines**: Up to 4% of your global annual turnover (€20 million maximum).<br>• **Reprimands**: Instead of fines, a reprimand may be issued for minor infringements or if the fine would cause disproportionate burden.<br>• **Criminal penalties**: In some cases, criminal charges and imprisonment may apply.<br><br>**Examples**<br><br>* A company fails to notify data subjects about a personal data breach within 72 hours. They could face a fine of up to €10 million (1% of their global annual turnover).<br>* An organization uses inadequate security measures, resulting in the theft of sensitive customer data. They might receive a reprimand for minor infringement.<br>* A company deliberately ignores GDPR requirements and fails to protect personal data. In this case, criminal charges and imprisonment could be imposed.<br><br>Remember, it's essential to prioritize data protection and take proactive steps to ensure compliance with GDPR regulations!</p>
