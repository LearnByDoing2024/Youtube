            <h2>Response:</h2>
            <p>Let's break it down in a simple way.<br><br>**What should I do as an IT company to mitigate GDPR risk?**<br><br>-------------------------<br><br>1. **Understand the basics**: Familiarize yourself with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and its key principles, such as data protection by design and default, transparency, and accountability.<br>2. **Conduct a data audit**: Identify all personal data you process, where it's stored, and how it's used. This will help you understand your data flows and identify potential risks.<br>3. **Implement data protection measures**: Put in place technical and organizational measures to protect personal data, such as encryption, access controls, and pseudonymization.<br>4. **Get consent from users**: Ensure that you obtain explicit consent from individuals before processing their personal data, especially for sensitive information like health or financial data.<br>5. **Document everything**: Keep detailed records of your data processing activities, including data breaches, to demonstrate compliance with GDPR requirements.<br><br>**What are the penalties for non-compliance with GDPR?**<br><br>-------------------------<br><br>1. **Up to €20 million or 4% of global turnover**: The maximum fine for non-compliance with GDPR is capped at €20 million or 4% of your company's global annual turnover, whichever is higher.<br>2. **Data protection authorities (DPAs) can impose fines**: DPAs have the power to investigate and impose fines on companies that violate GDPR rules.<br>3. **Reputation damage**: Non-compliance with GDPR can also lead to reputational damage, as individuals may lose trust in your company's ability to protect their personal data.<br><br>**Examples of non-compliance:**<br><br>-------------------------<br><br>1. **Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal**: Facebook faced criticism for allowing third-party developers to access user data without explicit consent.<br>2. **Google's Street View privacy concerns**: Google was fined €100,000 by the French data protection authority (CNIL) for collecting personal data from Wi-Fi networks while taking street view images.<br>3. **Yahoo!'s data breach**: Yahoo! faced a massive data breach in 2013, exposing over 3 billion user accounts to hackers. The company failed to notify users promptly and was criticized for its handling of the incident.<br><br>Remember, GDPR is not just about avoiding fines; it's also about building trust with your customers and ensuring their personal data is protected.</p>
