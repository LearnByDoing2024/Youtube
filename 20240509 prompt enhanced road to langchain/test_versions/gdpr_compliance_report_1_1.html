            <p>As a IT company, you want to mitigate GDPR risk? Let's break it down in simple terms.

**What is GDPR?**
GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is a European Union law that aims to protect individuals' personal data and give them more control over how their data is used. It applies to any organization that processes the personal data of EU citizens, regardless of where the company is based.

**Why should you care about GDPR?**
Non-compliance with GDPR can lead to severe penalties, which can damage your reputation and financial stability. The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) has set out guidelines for fines, which can be up to:

* â‚¬20 million or 4% of the company's global annual turnover (whichever is greater)

**What are some examples of GDPR non-compliance?**

1. **Lack of consent**: Failing to obtain explicit consent from individuals before processing their personal data.
2. **Data breaches**: Not notifying affected individuals and authorities within a reasonable timeframe after discovering a data breach.
3. **Insufficient data protection by design and default**: Not implementing adequate security measures to protect personal data, such as encryption or pseudonymization.
4. **Inadequate record-keeping**: Failing to maintain accurate records of personal data processing activities.

**What can you do to mitigate GDPR risk?**

1. **Conduct a data audit**: Identify all personal data your company processes and assess its sensitivity and importance.
2. **Implement data protection by design and default**: Design your products and services with data protection in mind, and ensure that data is pseudonymized or encrypted when possible.
3. **Obtain explicit consent**: Ensure that individuals provide clear and informed consent before processing their personal data.
4. **Develop a breach response plan**: Establish procedures for responding to data breaches, including notification of affected individuals and authorities.
5. **Train your staff**: Educate employees on GDPR requirements and ensure they understand the importance of data protection.

By following these steps, you can reduce the risk of non-compliance with GDPR and protect your company's reputation and financial stability.

Remember, GDPR is not just a European Union regulation; it has global implications, and many countries have similar regulations in place. It's essential to prioritize data protection and ensure compliance with relevant regulations.</p>
