            <h2>Response:</h2>
            <p>Let's break it down in a simple way!<br><br>**Mitigating GDPR Risk**<br><br>To mitigate GDPR risk, I recommend:<br><br>• **Conduct regular data audits**: Identify and map all personal data processed by your company.<br>• **Implement robust security measures**: Use encryption, access controls, and secure storage for sensitive data.<br>• **Train employees**: Educate staff on GDPR requirements and best practices for handling personal data.<br>• **Develop a breach response plan**: Establish procedures for reporting and responding to data breaches.<br><br>**Penalties for Non-Compliance with GDPR**<br><br>If your company fails to comply with GDPR regulations, you may face:<br><br>• **Fines**: Up to €20 million or 4% of your global annual turnover (whichever is greater).<br>• **Reprimands**: Instead of fines, a reprimand may be issued for minor infringements.<br>• **Criminal penalties**: In some cases, criminal charges may be brought against individuals responsible for non-compliance.<br><br>**Examples**<br><br>* A company fails to notify the data subject about a personal data breach, resulting in a fine of €10 million.<br>* An employee accidentally sends sensitive customer data via email, and the company is reprimanded instead of fined due to the minor nature of the infringement.<br><br>Remember, GDPR compliance is crucial for protecting your customers' personal data. By implementing robust security measures and training employees, you can minimize the risk of non-compliance and avoid severe penalties!</p>
