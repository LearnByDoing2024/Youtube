            <p>The penalties for not following the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) rules can be quite severe.

**Fines**

* Up to â‚¬20 million or 4% of a company's global annual turnover, whichever is greater.
* This means that if your company makes a lot of money, you could face a huge fine if you don't follow the GDPR rules.

**Other penalties**

* Public censures: The supervisory authority (like the Data Protection Authority in each country) can publicly criticize your company for not following the GDPR rules.
* Orders to stop processing data: If you're found to be breaking the rules, the supervisory authority can order you to stop processing personal data until you fix the issues.
* Compensation for individuals: If someone's personal data is compromised because of your non-compliance, they may be able to claim compensation from your company.

**Reputation damage**

* Non-compliance with GDPR can also damage your company's reputation and lead to a loss of trust among customers and stakeholders.

Remember, the GDPR is in place to protect individuals' personal data. By following the rules, you're not only avoiding penalties but also showing that you care about people's privacy and security.</p>
