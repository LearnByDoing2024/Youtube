line-by-line explanation of the code, along with the general workflow sequence:

Importing libraries and setting up resources

import pandas as pd: Import the pandas library and assign it the alias pd.
import pdfplumber: Import the pdfplumber library for working with PDF files.
import nltk: Import the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library for natural language processing tasks.
import tensorflow_hub as hub: Import the TensorFlow Hub library for working with pre-trained models.
import numpy as np: Import the NumPy library and assign it the alias np.
from openai import OpenAI: Import the OpenAI library for interacting with the OpenAI API.
import tensorflow as tf: Import the TensorFlow library for building and running machine learning models.
import os as os: Import the OS library and assign it the alias os.
from numpy.linalg import norm: Import the norm function from NumPy's linear algebra module.
Ensuring NLTK resources are available

nltk.download('punkt'): Download the NLTK data package for tokenization ( sentence splitting).

Defining a Simple Vector Store class

    11-24. Define a SimpleVectorStore class that stores document embeddings and corresponding text documents. The class has methods for adding documents, searching for similar documents based on embeddings, and retrieving the top-k similar documents.

Loading the Universal Sentence Encoder

embed = hub.load("https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder/4"): Load the pre-trained Universal Sentence Encoder model from TensorFlow Hub.
Defining functions for text processing and embedding

26-33. Define functions for:
    * embed_text: Convert a list of text chunks to embeddings using the Universal Sentence Encoder.
    * load_csv_data: Load CSV files into a single Pandas DataFrame.
    * csv_to_text: Convert a CSV file to a text file with each row represented as a string.
    * load_and_extract_text: Extract text from a file (PDF or text file).
    * nltk_sentence_splitter: Split text into sentences using NLTK.
    * load_and_split_text: Load and split text into sentences.

Defining functions for setting up vector stores(2)

34-41. Define functions for:
    * setup_vector_store_1: Set up a vector store with text chunks from a PDF file.
    * setup_vector_store_2: Set up a vector store with text chunks from a CSV file.

Defining the generate_response function

42-51. Define a function generate_response that takes a query, two vector stores, and generates a response using the OpenAI API. The function:
    * Embeds the query using the Universal Sentence Encoder.
    * Searches for similar documents in both vector stores.
    * Creates a prompt by joining the similar documents and the query.
    * Uses the OpenAI API to generate a response to the prompt.

Defining functions for saving reports

52-63. Define functions for:
    * save_to_html: Save a query and response to an HTML file.
    * save_debug_info_to_html: Save debug information (e.g., dataframes, text chunks, embeddings) to an HTML file.

Main execution

64-73. The main execution sequence:
    * Load CSV data and convert it to text.
    * Load and split text from a PDF file and a CSV file.
    * Set up two vector stores using the text chunks.
    * Define a user query.
    * Generate a response using the generate_response function.
    * Print the response.
    * Save the query and response to an HTML file.
    * Save debug information to an HTML file.

The general workflow sequence is:

    Load and preprocess data (CSV and PDF files).
    Set up vector stores using the preprocessed data.
    Define a user query.
    Generate a response using the vector stores and the OpenAI API.
    Save the query and response to an HTML file.
    Save debug information to an HTML file.


        version_4 solved df tensor issue by converting df to txt
        version_4 involves data cleaning
        version_4 incoporated txt doc handling
        version_4 change the data input as text imput, text_chunks_1
        

GENERAL COMMENT:

"The code extracts and processes textual data from documents and structured data from CSV 
files. It uses embeddings to determine the relevance of stored documents to a user's prompt. 
It then combines these relevant documents with the prompt to query a language model (LLM), 
generating a comprehensive response."

    Regarding database management, the script does not explicitly manage a database like SQL or NoSQL
    databases. However, it does implement basic data management through the following mechanisms:

    Vector Store as a Simple Data Repository:
    The SimpleVectorStore class acts as a rudimentary in-memory storage system, managing embeddings 
    and their associated text documents. While not a database in the traditional sense, it functions
    similarly by storing and retrieving data based on similarity in a vector space.
    
    Data Loading and Concatenation:
    The script loads data from CSV files into pandas DataFrames, which are powerful data structures
    for manipulating tabular data. This isn't database management per se, but it is a form of data 
    handling that involves querying and merging data, akin to some database operations.
    
    If your application requires more sophisticated data handling or persistent storage, integrating 
    a proper database system (like SQLite for smaller scale or PostgreSQL for larger scale 
    applications) might be necessary. This would provide robust data management capabilities 
    such as indexing, more complex queries, concurrent data access, and persistence.
