# AutoGen Command Line Code Executor Demo

This project demonstrates the implementation and usage of AutoGen's Command Line Code Executor functionality, showcasing how to execute Python code programmatically using AutoGen's powerful automation capabilities. Watch the full tutorial on [Learn By Doing with Steven YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/).

## Project Overview

The project illustrates:
1. Basic command line code execution
2. Integration with AutoGen agents
3. Automated code generation and execution
4. Interactive coding demonstrations

## Project Structure

### Files
- `20240430 Command Line Code Executor.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the implementation and examples
- `README.md`: Project documentation

## Features

### Basic Code Execution üîß
- Local command line code execution setup
- Temporary directory management
- Code block execution with output capture
- Error handling and execution status reporting

### Agent Integration ü§ñ
- ConversableAgent implementation
- Code execution configuration
- Agent-based code generation
- Interactive chat capabilities

### Example Applications üìä
- Fibonacci number calculation
- Basic Python script execution
- Output capture and display
- Temporary file management

## Technical Implementation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Required packages:
  ```bash
  pip install pyautogen
  ```

### Core Components
1. **LocalCommandLineCodeExecutor** üõ†Ô∏è
   - Manages code execution environment
   - Handles file I/O operations
   - Provides execution status and output

2. **ConversableAgent** üí¨
   - Facilitates code generation
   - Manages execution flow
   - Handles user interactions

### Code Examples

#### Basic Execution
```python
from pathlib import Path
from autogen.coding import CodeBlock, LocalCommandLineCodeExecutor

work_dir = Path("coding")
executor = LocalCommandLineCodeExecutor(work_dir=work_dir)
```

#### Agent Setup
```python
from autogen import ConversableAgent

code_executor_agent = ConversableAgent(
    "code_executor_agent",
    llm_config=False,
    code_execution_config={"executor": executor},
    human_input_mode="ALWAYS"
)
```

## Usage Guide

1. Clone the repository
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pyautogen
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter notebook
4. Follow the examples and run the demonstrations

## Security Best Practices üîí
- Code execution in isolated environments
- Temporary directories for file operations
- Human verification option for code execution
- Timeout settings for execution control
- Regular security updates
- Input validation and sanitization
