# Model Prompts and Enhancements

1. **Prompts to 4o Model**
   - Random figures on operations or booking records
   - No balancing act

2. **Prompts to 4o1 Model**
   - Struggles with coding
   - Suitable for short-scale simulation

3. **Prompt Enhancement on 4o Model**
   - Use in 4o1 Model after iterations
   - Results progression:
     - From empty file
     - To file with transactions and no booking records
     - To booking records with balancing on credit and debit

4. **Prompt Enhancement on 4o Model**
   - Incorporate the latest 4o1 results
   - Generated Italy accounting rule list
   - Evaluation of the notebook on accounting rules

5. **Return to 4o1**
   - Review results

6. **Preliminary Results**
   - After several iterations, we have a preliminary result for simulation of booking records and validation.

7. **Possible Improvements**
   - Agentic flow with accounting rule RAG
   - Robust database structure for data management and report generation
   - Generation of client, regulatory, and accounting reports, along with audit capabilities
   - Swift message exchange simulation
   - Detailed logic design, fx descripency, etc
