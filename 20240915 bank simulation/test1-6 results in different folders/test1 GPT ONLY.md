Simulating a day of bank operations involves a series of financial transactions that impact various accounts, ledgers, and ultimately the daily financial report. Below is an outline of the steps for simulating bank operations, along with the simulated ledger and financial report.

### Key Operations:
1. **Taking Deposits**
   - Clients deposit money into their accounts.
   - Increase customer account balance and update the bank's liabilities (customer deposits).

2. **Disbursing Loans**
   - Bank grants loans to customers.
   - Increase the customer loan ledger and reduce cash reserves.

3. **Making Payments for Clients**
   - Bank processes payments on behalf of clients, e.g., utility bills, mortgage payments.
   - Reduce customer account balance and adjust interbank settlement.

4. **Treasury Transactions**
   - Bank manages liquidity by transferring funds to/from NOSTRO accounts (foreign currency accounts).
   - Adjust NOSTRO account balance, cash reserves, and forex positions.

5. **End-of-Day Ledger Updates**
   - Calculate all income and expenses (interest on loans, fees for services).
   - Generate financial reports, such as daily profit and loss, balance sheet, and liquidity positions.

### Step 1: Initialize the Bank Accounts

Let's simulate the initial balances of a few key accounts for the day:
- Customer Deposits: $5,000,000
- Loans Outstanding: $2,000,000
- Cash Reserves: $1,000,000
- NOSTRO Accounts: $500,000
- Customer Payments Pending: $100,000
