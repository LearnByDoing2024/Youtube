# Data Mining and Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains four interesting projects based on the concepts discussed in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfPJ6kyWb7U).

## Project 1: Finding Similar Items
A data mining project that implements similarity detection algorithms to find similar items in a dataset. This project demonstrates:
- Implementation of MinHash algorithm
- Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH)
- Jaccard similarity measurement
- Efficient similarity search in large datasets

## Project 2: Market-Basket Analysis
An implementation of association rule mining to analyze shopping patterns and customer behavior:
- Apriori algorithm implementation
- Frequent itemset mining
- Association rule generation
- Support and confidence metrics calculation

## Project 3: Link Analysis
A project focusing on analyzing network structures and relationships:
- PageRank algorithm implementation
- Web graph analysis
- Node importance calculation
- Link structure visualization

## Project 4: Plant Leave Recognizer
A machine learning project for plant species identification through leaf analysis:
- Image preprocessing and feature extraction
- Deep learning model implementation
- Transfer learning with pre-trained networks
- Real-time leaf classification
