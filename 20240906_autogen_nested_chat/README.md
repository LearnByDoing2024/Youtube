# AutoGen Nested Chat Implementation

This project demonstrates advanced nested chat implementations using Microsoft's AutoGen framework, as shown in [this tutorial video](https://youtu.be/eEwkQTaRCDs).

## Overview
This project showcases:
- Implementation of nested conversations between multiple AI agents
- Complex problem-solving through agent collaboration
- Dynamic task delegation and management
- Advanced AutoGen framework features

## Features
- ü§ñ Multiple AI agent interactions
- üîÑ Nested conversation flows
- üìù Task breakdown and delegation
- üéØ Goal-oriented problem solving
- üîç Context awareness between agents
- üìä Structured conversation management

## Key Components
1. Agent Types:
   - Assistant Agent: Primary problem solver
   - Code Expert: Handles code-related tasks
   - Planner: Manages task breakdown
   - Reviewer: Validates solutions
   
2. Conversation Patterns:
   - Sequential discussions
   - Nested problem-solving
   - Parallel agent interactions
   - Context preservation

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Required packages:
  ```bash
  pip install pyautogen
  pip install openai
  ```
- OpenAI API key or compatible LLM setup

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Configure your API keys in `config.json`
4. Run the example:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage Examples
1. Basic Nested Chat:
   ```python
   python examples/basic_nested_chat.py
   ```
2. Multi-Agent Problem Solving:
   ```python
   python examples/multi_agent_solving.py
   ```

## Configuration
- Agent configuration in `config.json`
- Conversation flow settings
- Model parameters
- Logging preferences

## Best Practices
- Define clear agent roles
- Structure conversations properly
- Handle context effectively
- Implement proper error handling
- Monitor agent interactions

## Troubleshooting
Common issues and solutions:
- API authentication errors
- Agent communication timeouts
- Context management issues
- Memory limitations
